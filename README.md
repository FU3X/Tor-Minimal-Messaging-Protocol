# TOR Minimal Messaging Protocol - TMMP

### About
This is an open source project that routes all messeges through TOR, end to end encrypted, with the main focus of being ingognito. Its completly decenteralized,
and each host can have multiple contained rooms with seperate encryption. It will be light and minimal to keep away bugs and vulnerabilities.

Make pull/merge requests to this repository, I will review, test your code, then decide.

### Other details
This project will be rewritten in this repository as it faces completion (rewritten up to a few times to improve preformance).
Hopefully it will also be rewritten in Rust, and/or an even faster langauge if one comes.
